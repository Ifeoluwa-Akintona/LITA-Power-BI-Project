### Data Model

#### Relationships
Product Table: Includes unique product names to relate product information.

Date Table: Generated to support time intelligence and linked to order_date.

Customer Table: Provides customer details, linked via customer_id.

### Key Measures

- TotalSales = SUM(CleanSalesData1[TotalRevenue])
  
- Sales Percentage for each Product (Taking 'Gloves' as an example): Gloves Percentage = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(SUM('CleanSalesData1'[TotalRevenue]), 'CleanSalesData1'[Product] = "Gloves"),
    [TotalSales],
    0)
    
- TotalQuantity = = SUM(CleanSalesData1[Quantity])

### Data Transformations
- Order Date: Converted to date data type and used to create additional columns for month, quarter, and year.
- Date Table: Created a date table for easier time analysis.
- Total Sales Calculation: Added a custom column in Power BI to calculate total_sales based on quantity * unit_price.

## 4. Data Cleaning and Preparation

### Data Cleaning Steps:

a) Null Handling: Removed rows with missing values in critical fields like Subscription Start, Subscription End.

b) Data Transformation: Converted date fields to a standard format and calculated Duration where necessary.

c) Calculated Columns:
- Active Subscription Count: Count of active subscriptions based on Status.
- Average Subscription Duration: Calculated the average duration across all customers.
  
d) Data Validation:
- Ensured no duplicate Customer IDs.
- Checked data consistency for each region and subscription type.

## 5. Data Analysis
Key Analyses Conducted:

- Customer Churn Analysis: Filtered Status = "Inactive" and "Active"; calculated the percentage of cancellations
- Revenue Analysis: Summed the total revenue for each subscription type and region.
- Duration Analysis: Calculated average and maximum subscription durations.

### DAX Measures:
a) DAX Measure for calculating active subscription count:
`Active Subscription Count = CALCULATE(COUNTA('Clean Data'[Status]), 'Clean Data'[Status] = "Active")`

b) DAX Measure for calculating inactive subscription count:
`Inactive Subscription Count = CALCULATE(COUNTA('Clean Data'[Status]), 'Clean Data'[Status] = "Inactive")`

c) DAX Measure for calculating cancellation rate:
`Cancellation Rate = DIVIDE(
        [Inactive Subscription Count], 
        ([Inactive Subscription Count] + [Active Subscription Count]), 
        0)`
