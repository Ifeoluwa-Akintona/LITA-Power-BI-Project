### Data Model

#### Relationships
Product Table: Includes unique product names to relate product information.

Date Table: Generated to support time intelligence and linked to order_date.

Customer Table: Provides customer details, linked via customer_id.

### Key Measures

- TotalSales = SUM(CleanSalesData1[TotalRevenue])
  
- Sales Percentage for each Product (Taking 'Gloves' as an example): Gloves Percentage = 
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(SUM('CleanSalesData1'[TotalRevenue]), 'CleanSalesData1'[Product] = "Gloves"),
    [TotalSales],
    0)
    
- TotalQuantity = = SUM(CleanSalesData1[Quantity])

### Data Transformations
- Order Date: Converted to date data type and used to create additional columns for month, quarter, and year.
- Date Table: Created a date table for easier time analysis.
- Total Sales Calculation: Added a custom column in Power BI to calculate total_sales based on quantity * unit_price.
